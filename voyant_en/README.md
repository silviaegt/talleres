# Introduction to Distant Reading with Voyant Tools


:calendar: Friday 20 May, 09:00am - 10:45am, Leipzig University

## 1. Goal

Learn how to do “distant reading” (gain a bird's eye view over many texts with computational methods) with a tool that doesn't require installation: Voyant Tools. In this workshop we will use the Programming Historian tutorial in Spanish [Corpus analysis with Voyant Tools](https://doi.org/10.46430/phes0043) as a base and we will show how to adapt it to analyze another open corpus of texts.


## 2. Workshop facilitator

[Silvia Gutiérrez](https://twitter.com/espejolento) studied the Digital Humanities Master at the University of Wurzburg and at King's College London. She is a co-founder of RLadiesCDMX and a volunteer for Wikipedia and Wikidata because she wants to think that sharing will be the new having. For five years she worked as the first Digital Humanities Librarian at El Colegio de México where she taught various workshops on the use of tools and the application of computational methods for the Humanities and Social Sciences. She is currently doing her PhD at the [Computational Humanities group at the University of Leipzig](https://ch.uni-leipzig.de/team/).
